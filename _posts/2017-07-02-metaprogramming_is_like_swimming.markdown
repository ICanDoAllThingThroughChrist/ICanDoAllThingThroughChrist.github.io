Once I learned to metaprogam using "send" in a job assignment, I never forgot it.  
This experience reminded me of swim lessons, where once I learned the breast stroke, I never forgot it.  

I recall the fear of the water I once had, before I learned how to swim, and like swimming, I had a fear of metaprogramming. The first sound of 'metaprogramming' to a novice like me was fear.  What is it?

Yet, after rehearsing over the video, practiced repeatedly, I no longer had a fear of it as I saw it implemented on my own console. 

One of the main gem that allowed me to implement the workflow is pry-rescue, and once I implemented it, I swim among the waters of ruby errors troubleshooting. My first CLI gem resulted for work assignment. The only challenge now is to use ActiveRecord to save and persist in a database!

here is the youtube video that introduced me to pry-rescue. it rescued me.
