At first reading of the CLI requirement around beginning of May earlier this year, I thought
"are you kidding me? I am having problems with CSS selectors AND now the lesson requires webscraping?"  
But 30 days later, after 1.5 weeks of Sabbatical in British Columbia, I felt refreshed to tackle the subject around 3rd week of May, and here we are June 5th, I completed the CLI programming. 

couple of milestones along the way

1.problem: CSS selector ID failure
solution: Chrome Selector Gadget
duration to discovery: a week after vacation, 2 weeks before sabbatical vacation

2.problem: setting up file structure
solution: watched CLI videos from Flatiron
duration to discover: a day after sabbatical vacation

3.problem: iteration appeared more than expected in the scraper target method
solution: wrote a while loop with condition of less than 1 iteration and start counting at 1, reviewed problem solving algorthim and data structure
duration: 2 days

4.problem: the scraped data was not formatted with header fields
solution: CLI videos and session with Avi cleared this up
duration: 2 days

5.problem: more iterations than desirable for the scrapped data
solution: session with Avi and googled for examples to arrive at an iterator

here I am 30 days after first reading the CLI requirement in early May, CLI is completed. Longer than planned, but I am still learning so my family and I have endured and succeeded.
