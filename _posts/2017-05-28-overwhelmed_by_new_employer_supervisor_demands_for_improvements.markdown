It has been evident in public service that with new employers supervisor and administration in 2015, my performance metric has changed from memo based to Six Sigma in Project Management.  As a project manager, with over 34 regulatory permits in the performance review, I became overwhelmed.  Yet, there is definite solution in project management: software vendors.  

Software vendors such as ESRI, Zoho, have provided solutions to non-programmers such as myself to meet the challenges of new employment in project management over various areas.  However, given the customized demands of the new employer's supervisor where ESRI and Zoho cannot provide in a timely manner, I became convinced that I should embark on a different skillset to provide for myself and loved ones, in software development.  

Without reservation, I read voraciously in order to ensure I pass employer annual performance report metric of process improvement, and invested $1200-$1500, 80-120 hours, in PMP certification in spring of 2016. Thankfully, by grace of God, my marriage survived and I passed annual performance metric reports in 2016.  However, more performance metric changes rose in the horizon, employer performance review changed from annual to quarterly review in late 2016.  Without understanding in programming logic or web based programming skills, yet it has become the basis of the employers method and process, I decided to apply to Flatiron, and suspended my second graduated studies in Master of Finance. Flatiron accepted my application and I began my studies in Fall of 2016.  With the decision, we experienced disappointments, for hopes of employment in Finance industry were set aside, in order to invest in new skillset, software development.
