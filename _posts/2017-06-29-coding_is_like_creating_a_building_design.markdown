Since my background is an architect, where experiences and theory works together, I repeatly came across same idea. Theory of ordered list and unordered list is executed with Array and Hash. Theory of enumerating through a list seems to vary in various methods, each, each_with_index, and other instances in applications. Given Ruby is my first programming language, where I had written my first collaborating program with Mr.Google, Pry Rescue, and without Learn IDE, it became evident to me that coding is like building design, experience and theory over time resulted in a verifiable product. 

The frustration is time to learn a new job skill.  Patience and time are limited, yet demand in all forms seems endless.
